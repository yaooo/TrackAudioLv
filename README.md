# TrackAudioLv
## Two methods are provided for tracking the sound level.
```
Plotting the absolute energy of the sound source. 
Plotting the dB(decibel) distribution of the sound source.
```
### NOTICE: 

* If there are more than one sound tracks, the code only will take the first one.
* Feel free to change Volume.py to maybe create multiple plots for the input source that has more than more tracks.
